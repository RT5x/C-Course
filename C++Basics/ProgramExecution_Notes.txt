/*
C++ code is written:

The compiler creates a binary File that is not readable by a human
    Binary System used by CPU (Stored into Random Access Memory):
        - Allocates storage on memory for each variable and statement.
        - The function is stored in completely separately allocated memory.
            Returns to reading statements in order after jumping to a new statement.

/*
C++ Core Language vs. Standard Library Vs STL

    C++ Core Language features:
        - Basic building block of the C++ language. "The foundation of basic C++ programs".
        - Syntax, how variables are defined, basic features of C++
        - Defines how code is written and interpreted by the compiler.
    
    Standard Library:
        - Set of ready-to-use components that are easily used in C++ programs.
        - Uses a hashtag (#) to include specialized library to be used in your program.
        - Standard libary features are used to speed up writing a program, or even making it easier to read.

    STL: 
        - Part of the standard library, but is a collection of container types.
        - Allows storage of collections, algorithms, and specialized types (iterators) that allow to navegate through the containers.
        - Essentially a highly specialized part of the C++ standard libaries.
